# Server Manager Dashboard

## Project's brief:

- Fully dynamic: Assume that any value can be changed, removed or added without
breaking your page or application. For all we know, this list could grow to 352 nodes
tomorrow.
- Assume that the API can be unreachable. Error messages would be nice in that case.
- Self-updating. If the API endpoint prints out new data, update existing values as
efficiently as possible.
- Ensure your code is clean, secure and readable.
- You must document your thought processes.
- Youâ€™re being given a lot of data from that endpoint - consider pagination.

### The project was made with ReactJS with no other frameworks attached. Styling is plain CSS and one component was added from npm, which is react-paginate.
